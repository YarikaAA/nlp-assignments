This is the reasonable assumption, since in most cases, spelling mistakes are more likely simple typographical errors or single-character errors.

The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of Fire! Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window.
